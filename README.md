# Welcome to Everybody Codes!

Unleash your problem-solving skills by tackling puzzles with code, in **any programming language you love.** Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, our platform offers challenges for all levels, allowing you to learn, grow, and have fun along the way!

Dive into the world of coding, solve exciting puzzles, and join a community of passionate problem solvers. Ready to code your way through challenges? Let’s get started and uncover the secrets awaiting you!

Don’t forget to invite your friends and see who can rise to the top! The more minds at work, the more fun and exciting the challenge becomes!

Every puzzle you solve brings you one step closer to completing a greater mechanism, a complex structure that only the most skilled will fully uncover. Piece by piece, you'll unlock parts of this intricate system, with each success revealing a new layer of its design. But beware, only the sharpest minds will be able to see it in its entirety.

Every Quest starts with **Part I**, which is designed for everyone to solve within a reasonable amount of time, even if you don't have any coding skills, so everyone can join in!

Once you provide the correct answer, **Part II** will open. It's a continuation of Part I, but a little more complicated. It usually needs some coding skills, or at least some knowledge of Excel.

Solving Part II takes you to **Part III**. This part aims to challenge you as much as possible!

Remember, you're **solving puzzles**, not finding general solutions, so checking your input notes could be important! **Each part has different input notes**, so make sure that you copy the proper one.
